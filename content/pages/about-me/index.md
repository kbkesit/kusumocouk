Well, if you are curious, I'll tell you.
My full name is Kesit Budi Kusumo. You can call me either Kesit or Kusumo.

I'm just an ordinary person who has an interest as software engineer. My proficiency of programming language including c++, python, and dart(a language behind flutter).

Aside from that, I'm also a blogger of this blog. In this blog, I give useful tips related to programming and my personal life. I hope you enjoy being here reading my posts.
