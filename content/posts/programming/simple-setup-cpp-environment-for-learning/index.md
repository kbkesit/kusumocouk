Hello,

In this post, I'd like to give my simple way to setup c++ environment. Therefore, please don't expect too much in this post, since this is suitable for a newbie. To be frankly, this is what I used when I was new to c++ language.

So let's do it together:

## C++ Compiler
If you are using Linux OS like myself, the OS is already shipped with c++ compiler. To check, you can type this command on your terminal:
```
g++ --version
```
If you get something like this:
```
g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11) 5.4.0 20160609
Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
It means you already have c++ compiler installed on your system.
For other OS users, please refer to this link: <https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs250PreTest/latest/Public/installingACompiler/>.

## IDE
There are tons of c++ IDE (Integrated Development Environment) out there, whether it's free or not.

For free version, I recommend you to use Codelite IDE which is available on: <https://codelite.org/>.

For paid version, I recommend you to use CLion. You can get it on their official website: [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). This is the most powerful IDE out there and I'm currently using.

Okay, that's all for now. If I'm missing something important, please state it on the comment section below.

Thank you & have a good day.
